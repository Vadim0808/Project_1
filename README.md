# Project_1
The project's task is to conduct a classification of data collected at a small steel manufacturing company, DAEWOO Steel Co. Ltd, in South Korea. The goal is to predict the target variable, the type of load (Load_Type) at the station, represented by three categories - Light Load, Medium Load, Maximum Load. There are a total of 8 independent variables and one target variable. The data was taken from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/851/steel+industry+energy+consumption For classification, the "Decision Tree" model will be used To measure the effectiveness of the model, the F1 macro metric will be used because the categories in the target variable are not evenly distributed, but they represent equal importance
